# Framingham Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the Framingham Heart Study dataset to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The project focuses on:

- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model development:** Implementing multiple machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation:** Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NishitSinha/Framingham-Heart-Disease-.git
   cd Framingham-Heart-Disease-
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `Framingham_Heart_disease.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells to execute the analysis and model predictions.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed results on model performance, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
